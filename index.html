    <h3>Introducing myself..</h3>
    <p>
      Hi everyone! My name is Irida. I have been teaching greek to chinese
      students, who live or not in Greece and attend or not greek schools, for
      many years now.
    </p>
    <h3>How did this journey begin..</h3>
    <p>
      Everything started many years ago, when I met my first chinese student. Of
      course at first she was just a little girl I met somewhere, who caught my
      eye because of her adorable personality. Her family got to know me better
      and finally asked me if I can teach her greek. When I decided to teach for
      the first time, someone who was foreign speaker I didn't have any official
      material to work with. I was working only with a book I had found online
      (made by volunteer teachers) and whatever material I created by myself
      (exercises, texts etc). Despite the difficulties, I managed to teach that
      little girl greek, she managed to be part of my society and one led to
      another and I had the blessing to create a very big circle of chinese
      students. Of course, after all these years, the material I use has
      changed, became better, more effecient and more qualified for this
      difficult but intersting journey of knowledge. After all these years, I
      grow more and more love for this job and of course my students. I also
      felt the need and interest to learn chinese and let this fact bring me
      closer to my students' customs and culture. My goal is to be able to share
      this ancient and beautiful language with even more students with bright
      minds and real thirst to learn new cultures and languages.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I start the courses?</h3>
    <p>
      First of all, there are many levels in greek language.
      <b>If you already have been taught greek</b> with or without teacher in
      the past, we will check your level of knowledge and we will place on the
      right following level. <b>If not</b>, depending on your age, we will start
      from the beginning using the suitable material.
